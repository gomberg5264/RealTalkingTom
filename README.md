# Real Talking tom
This was done for kids for fun.  Click on the head to start talking. You can choose your language in which you are comfortable to talk. 
Currently using Yandex API for translation , but Microsoft and Google API should be better for translation. Couldn't use them  because google and mircosoft were asking for my credit card even for their free trial api key.
